# lattice-voting-ctrsa21

Code accompannying the paper "Lattice-Based Proof of Shuffle and Applications to Electronic Voting" by Diego F. Aranha, Carsten Baum, Kristian Gjøsteen,
Tjerand Silde, and Thor Tunge accepted at CT-RSA 2021. The code has been revised post-publication for quality and performance.

## WARNING

This is an academic proof of concept and has not received code review.
This implementation is NOT ready for any type of production use, in particular because of the attack below.

Bootle, Lyubashevsky and Merino-Gallardo, ["Efficient Verifiable Mixnets from
Lattices, Revisited"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/658), showed that our proof
is not sound, and mounted a working attack against this implementation.

**This branch does not contain the fix.** Work on the countermeasure of Lemma 5
of that paper lives on the `fix-pkc` branch, along with a draft of the
corresponding soundness argument.

## Building

Dependencies are the GMP and FLINT libraries. FLINT 3 or later is recommended;
the sources use the context-based `fmpz_mod_poly` interface, so releases older
than FLINT 2.8 will not build.

For building the code, run `make` inside the source directory. This will build the binaries for `commit`, `vericrypt` and `shuffle` to test and benchmark different modules of the code.

Each binary runs its tests and then its benchmarks. Since the benchmarks
dominate the runtime by two orders of magnitude, either phase can be selected
on its own:

    make test     # every binary, tests only
    make bench    # every binary, benchmarks only
    ./shuffle test

The tests are also run under AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer in
CI, which is what keeps the allocation behaviour honest:

    make CFLAGS="-O1 -g -march=native -pthread \
      -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all" test

## Third-party code

`vcl/` vendors Agner Fog's Vector Class Library, used by the constant-time
discrete Gaussian sampler in `gaussian_ct.cpp` (by Raymond K. Zhao).
